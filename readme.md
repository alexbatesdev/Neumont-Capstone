# My Capstone Project

## Project Overview
I aim to create a website creation tool that leverages ChatGPT4 to speed up and lower the bar for the web development process. The idea is that you can select your framework, explain the kind of website you want, then ChatGPT will generate a lot of the code and my application will visualize the code live while also allowing you to make edits and continue development.

## Tech Stack
-	React
-	Fastapi
-	Mongodb
-	ChatGPT 4 API
-	Docker Web container stuff
-	Kafka
-	Gitlab
-	Kong or Ocelot Gateway

# Setup

Writing this before I've written a single line of code.

Startup will likely include filling out one or more .env files, then running a docker-compose command.

To run the undockerized frontend run `npm run dev` in the react-app directory.

For storybook use check the readme in the react-app directory.
